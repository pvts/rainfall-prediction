# Rainfall prediction - WIP

EDA and predictions using Machine Learning on a dataset containing weather data obtained from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. An extra column to the existing dataset called 'Rain Tomorrow' has been manually added. You can find the original dataset (segregated) below;

Our first aim is to explore the dataset (EDA) by using graphs to visualize any interesting patterns/trends. Machine and Deep Learning classifiers are deployed to predict whether, based on the current set of features, it will rain in the following day.
