# Rainfall prediction

EDA and predictions using Machine Learning models on a dataset containing weather data obtained from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. An extra column to the existing dataset called `Rain Tomorrow` has been manually added, which predicts the probability of observing rain on the following day. You can find the original dataset (segregated) below;

Our first aim is to explore the dataset (EDA) by using graphs to visualize any interesting patterns/trends. Machine and Deep Learning classifiers are deployed to predict whether, based on the current set of features, it will rain on the following day.
